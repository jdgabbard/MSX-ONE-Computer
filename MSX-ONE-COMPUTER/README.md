# MSX-ONE Mainboard



Currently, v1.0 of the Mainboard is untested.  Two insignificant changes were made to the mainboard from version P1.1: the addition of a loading resistor on the -12v circuit, and a slight change to page select logic (should have no impact in function).  However, with that in mind, it is at this time untested.  Use of Prototype P1.1 version of the main board is preferable, as it is tested and functional at this time.  This will be changed as soon as I have a chance to order new boards and properly test them, in a few weeks.


BOM is being developed, along with a list of Digikey and Mouser part numbers.  Stay tuned...
